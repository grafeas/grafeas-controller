# Kritis

Kritis (“judge” in Greek), is an open-source solution for securing your software supply chain for Kubernetes applications. Kritis enforces deploy-time security policies using the [Google Cloud Container Analysis API](https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/api/reference/rest/), and in a subsequent release, [Grafeas](https://github.com/grafeas/grafeas).

Here is an example Kritis policy, to prevent the deployment of Pod with a critical vulnerability unless it has been whitelisted:

```yaml
imageWhitelist:
- gcr.io/my-project/whitelist-image@sha256:<DIGEST>
packageVulnerabilityPolicy:
  maximumSeverity: HIGH
  whitelistCVEs:
    providers/goog-vulnz/notes/CVE-2017-1000082
    providers/goog-vulnz/notes/CVE-2017-1000082
```

In addition to the enforcement this project also contains *signers* that can be
use to create [Grafeas](https://github.com/grafeas/grafeas) Attestation
Occurrences to be used in other enforcement systems like [Binary
Authorization](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/).  For details see
[Kritis Signer](signer_install.md).
