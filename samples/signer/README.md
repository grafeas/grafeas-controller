This sample code demonstrates how to use Kritis with Google Cloud Platform's
Binary Authorization feature.

The setup.sh script will:
- Configure your project with all necessary APIs
- Build a custom python based vulnerability analysis polling builder
- Build a custom Kritis vulnerability attestation signing builder
- Set up keys for the vulnerability attestation
- Set up the attestor
- Create a cluster to deploy into

Once everything is set up, you can see it work by running:
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-good.yaml .

And to exercise a negative case run:
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-bad.yaml

To set up this demo:
- click the link below to clone this repo in Cloud Shell
- cd samples/signer
- gcloud config set project YOURPROJECTNAME
- ./setup.sh
